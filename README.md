# Interpretable Part-Whole Hierarchies and Conceptual-Semantic Relationships in Neural Networks

This repository contains an implementation based on the paper detailing interpretable part-whole hierarchies and conceptual-semantic relationships in neural networks.

## Overview

This project aims to replicate the findings and concepts presented in the paper. The implementation focuses on:

- Creating a neural network architecture that incorporates part-whole hierarchies.
- Establishing conceptual-semantic relationships within the neural network.
- Providing tools and methods for interpreting the model's learned hierarchies and relationships.
